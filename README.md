# Parking Space Management system
python OpenCV project
A system that will find how many total cars are present and how many spaces are vacant 
to park. A Parking Management System Project in Python is a set of innovative technologies that 
provide parking sector solutions. Any parking management system’s main concept is self-
explanatory: it’s a system that assists individuals, businesses, and organizations in managing their 
parking spaces. When it comes to parking spaces, the system uses green and red to signify empty 
and occupied slots, accordingly. When the customer or any person who are all need to park their 
vehicle in the very large croud parking area the customer or any other car parkers will face the 
parking traffic and they will be in confused state where to park the car to avoid that we can use 
this project (Car, Truck, or Motorcycle) and the vehicle’s position in the parking slot. This program 
accepts any valid string as a car or any other vehicle. For a better user experience when using this 
Python vehicle parking management system, a clean and basic GUI with simple color 
combinations is presented. A cross-platform GUI toolkit Qt; PyQT is on board for its UI elements. 
The program also display’s the numbers of car or any other vehicle parking slots that are available 
in the car vehicle parking area and does not let the system add duplicate ones. After successfully 
adding, the system shows the entry time for two seconds, then the system returns to the main menu. 
If adding is unsuccessful-when there is no parking slot line drawn in that area the system will not 
show the spaces, the system shows an error then returns to the main menu(parking area).At any 
point, the user can view the information of any vehicle currently stored within the lot which it is 
helpful for the parking managing team that are alloted for the event or a parking area Selecting a 
valid row and space will return the space for the vehicle that will be displayed in the screen. 
Similarly, when the car or any other vehicle that are leaving the parking slot, the vehicle parker 
has to specify the row and space of the vehicle they want to remove after that the removed slot 
will be added to the free parking slot count. If space selection is valid, the vehicle will be removed 
from the space. The program will calculate a user’s fare based on how many hours were spent in 
the slot and there is no time limit for this project it can work 24/7 in a parking area. The system is 
web-based and developed with Python programing language and Flask web framework. In this 
project, we have used OpenCV to receive images from the camera and OpenALPR to recognize 
license plates and analyze them. Here I have used python to code and implement this project with 
the help of OpenCV on Wheels it’s a Pre-built CPU-only OpenCV packages for Python
